<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/karma.jpg" height="200" alt="Karma Tenzin's photo" />
<p>My name is Karma Tenzin, and I come from the small yet extraordinary Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. Nestled between
   India and China, Bhutan is known for its stunning landscapes, deeply rooted Buddhist traditions, and unique approach 
   to development, famously measuring progress through Gross National Happiness instead of GDP. As a Bhutanese, I take 
   great pride in my country's commitment to environmental conservationâ€”Bhutan is one of the few carbon-negative nations 
   in the world, with lush forests covering over 70% of our land. The culture here is vibrant and spiritual, shaped by 
   centuries-old monasteries, sacred festivals like Tshechu, and the wisdom of our spiritual leaders. Life in Bhutan may
   seem quiet to some, but it is full of depth, connection, and a sense of harmony with nature and community. Growing up
   in this peaceful and culturally rich environment has deeply influenced who I am today.</p>
